### Step 1

[install nix](https://nixos.org/download/)
> Nix is a package manager built around reproducibility, been trying it out lately for setting up development enviornments that are reproducable on more machines with less hassle. Feel free to try it out or just do a regular NPM install

### Step 2

run `nix-shell` in this directory to start dev shell (booting dev server automatically on port 5173)
(Ctrl + c, then ctrl + d to exit)

### Alternate Steps

Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`
